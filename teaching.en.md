Understanding is worth everything. I teach to help others pursue it.

While I’ve served primarily as a teaching assistant and MSG leader, my goal in teaching has always been to bring
clarity,
confidence, and curiosity into the learning process. I’ve been fortunate to receive positive feedback from students and
faculty alike, especially in helping others grasp foundational concepts in computer science.

Below are a few resources, review materials, and teaching contributions I’ve created or led during my time at Lafayette.

## Teaching Assistant & MSG Leader

My work as a TA and MSG at Lafayette involves helping during class periods and running my own sessions where students
can drop in to get help or review material. Below, I list courses I have served as a TA for and I link to any resources
that I created during those semesters.

### Fall 2025: CS 104 (Intro to Game Programming)

I'm super excited to continue working with our wonderful computer science department as a TA for our intro course. This
time around, I'm working with Professor Lopez, who I have had the pleasure of learning from in Spring 2025 in his Intro
to Machine Learning Class. I'm looking forward to more opportunities to grow my teaching skills.

**Professor**: Christian Lopez-Bencosome

**Resources**: Coming up after the conclusion of the semester.

### Spring 2025: CS 104 (Intro to Game Programming)

This semester was especially exciting for me, because I got to serve alongside the first professor I had at Lafayette.
Professor B is incredibly gifted at her job, and I am very grateful to have been able to help out!

**Professor**: Lauren Biernacki

**Resources**: You can view all the resources I created for this semester [here](https://github.com/jacksoneshbaugh/CS-104-Spring-2025).

### Fall 2024: CS 105 (Digital Media Computing)

This was my first semester of TAing. I learned valuable lessons and confirmed that I have a passion and a zeal for
teaching. Professor Smith is another outstanding faculty member in our incredible computer science department, and I'm
grateful to have been able to serve under his leadership.

**Professor**: Justin Smith
