Over the spring semester of 2024, I composed a piece for string quartet which I titled "2nd & Main." The Lafayette
College Contemporary Music Ensemble agreed to perform my piece on November 21, 2024, which was an experience I could
have never prepared for. The amount of joy and pride I felt that night was immeasurable, and many people told me that my
composition was their favorite of the night.

Here's what I wrote in the program notes for "2nd & Main:"

> Whether itâ€™s the motion of pedestrians, a family walking
> their dog, or the circulation of traffic, intersections are alive
> with movement. This piece explores the ebb and flow of an
> intersection, capturing its rhythm and reflecting its complex
> choreography.

I'd like to thank the Contemporary Music Ensemble, director Holly Roadfeldt, and the members of the string quartet who
performed the piece. I'd also like to highlight one performer, violist Jamie Lin, who was particularly helpful during
the composition of the piece. Thank you to these people, the audience, and everyone else who made this premiere
possible!
