I was inducted into the National Honor Society at Freedom High School in November 2022. The National Honor Society is a
nationwide organization that recognizes students who demonstrate excellence in scholarship, leadership, service, and
character.

During my time in NHS, I served the community through various service projects and events, like cleaning up local parks
and helping at a community book sale. I also participated in leadership activities and worked to maintain a high level
of academic achievement.

I am proud of my accomplishments and look forward to continuing my success in the future.
