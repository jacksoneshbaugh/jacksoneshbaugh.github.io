#### Lafayette recognizes its most outstanding applicants with a Marquis Scholarship or Fellowship.

The award is named after the Marquis de Lafayette, who left behind the safety of his aristocratic life in France to
fight for the cause of freedom in the American colonies. To form the Marquis Scholars/Fellows community, Lafayette seeks
students who have demonstrated intellectual curiosity in addition to superior academic achievement. Furthermore, the
College looks for students who are creatively engaged in the life of their communities and who, like the College’s
namesake, have “made a difference” through significant accomplishments in school and community.
