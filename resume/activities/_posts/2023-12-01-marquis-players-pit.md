I am a member of the Marquis Players Pit Orchestra, a group that performs at the annual Marquis Players musical. I'm a
trombonist in the orchestra and I enjoy the unique challenge that musical theater music presents. So far, I've played
one show with the Marquis Players: *Cabaret* in the spring of 2024. It was a great experience, and I look forward to
playing in future shows with the orchestra.
