I am a member of the Lafayette College Concert Band, a group that performs a variety of music, from classical to
contemporary, at various events throughout the year. I play the trombone in the band and have enjoyed the opportunity to
continue playing music in a group setting.

I've made many wonderful friends in the band and have enjoyed the camaraderie that comes with being part of a musical
ensemble. I look forward to continuing to perform with the Lafayette College Concert Band in the future.
