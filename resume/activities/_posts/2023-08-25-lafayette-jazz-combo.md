I am a member of the Lafayette College Jazz Combo, a smaller jazz ensemble that performs at an end-of-semester concert.
I play the trombone in the combo and have enjoyed the opportunity to perform with such a talented group of musicians.

Additionally, in the fall semester of 2023, I debuted as a jazz vocalist, performing the French tune "La Mer" by
Charles Trenet. The combo was excellent as a supporting band, and the performance went super well! It was such a fun
experience, and ever since I've sung at least one tune at every concert.

In the spring semester of 2024, I performed "Paper Moon" (no recording), and in the fall semester of the same year I
sang "My Kind of Town."

Throughout my time in Jazz Combo, I've learned a lot about jazz music and performance from my peers and have enjoyed the
opportunity to perform at the end of each semester.
