![Lafayette Pep Band](/images/pep-band.jpeg)

I am a member of the Lafayette Pep Band, a group that performs at various athletic events throughout the year. I play
the trombone in the band and enjoy both supporting our teams and entertaining the crowd with our music.

Pep Band was a great introduction to Lafayette—before I went to my orientation, I was able to meet some of my future
classmates and get a feel for the school. I'm grateful for the opportunities that I have had to play with the Pep Band
and look forward to continuing with it in the future.
