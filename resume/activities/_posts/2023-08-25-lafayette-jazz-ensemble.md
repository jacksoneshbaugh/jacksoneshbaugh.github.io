Recently dubbed the "Red Hot Chilli Leopards" (no, I'm not kidding), the Lafayette College Jazz Ensemble is a group of
talented musicians who come together to play jazz music. I play the trombone and sing lead vocals in the ensemble, and
I've enjoyed the opportunity to perform with such a talented group of musicians.

We're led by the talented Grammy-winner Jeff "Tain" Watts, who has been a great mentor to me and the rest of the
ensemble. I've learned a lot about jazz music and performance from him and have enjoyed the opportunity to perform at
the end of each semester.

The Spring 2024 semester was particularly exciting for me, as I had the privilege of singing with the
ensemble. I sang "Throw it Away" by Abbey Lincoln, and the performance went really well! It was such a fun experience,
and different from singing with the jazz combo (but both are fun!).

In the Fall 2024 semester, I had the privilege of continuing my jazz vocal journey with Jeff "Tain" Watts and the
Lafayette College Jazz Ensemble with this Frank Sinatra
classic tune, "The Way You Look Tonight," arranged by me. It was a super enjoyable experience—I always enjoy singing
with this band behind me!
