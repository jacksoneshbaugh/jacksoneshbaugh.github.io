I was a member of the Freedom High School Minuteman Jazz Band for three years. I played the trombone in the band and
enjoyed the opportunity to perform at various events throughout the school year. The Minuteman Jazz Band was a great way
for me to explore my passion for music and develop my skills as a musician. I am grateful for the experiences I had with
the band and the friendships I made along the way.

I really appreciated our focus on learning to play with jazz vocalists. In fact, many of the tunes I played trombone for
in high school are ones that I have or plan to sing with either of the jazz ensembles at Lafayette.
