Currently, I am a student at Lafayette College, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of
Arts in French with a minor in Biotechnology. I am expected to graduate in May 2027 and have maintained a 4.0 GPA
throughout my time at Lafayette College.

At Lafayette, I have taken a variety of courses in computer science and French, while maintaining invested in the
community that the college has to offer. I've been involved in plenty of clubs and organizations, such as the Lafayette
College Concert Band, Pep Band, Jazz Ensemble, and Jazz Combo. Additionally, I am the A/V Technician for and a member of
the
Shepherding Team of the Lafayette DiscipleMakers Christian Fellowship.

All in all, I'm blessed to be a part of the Lafayette College community and am excited to see what the future holds for
me as I continue my studies here.
