High school is where I learned how to learn, and I never shied away from challenging myself over these four years. For
example, I took 8 AP courses throughout my time at Freedom, alongside honors courses wherever possible. I also took an
English class online at Northampton Community College during my senior year (in order to fit AP Calculus BC into my
schedule).

I was also very involved during my high school years. I arrived most days before school began to rehearse with musical
groups and I stayed after for other extracurricular activities. I was a member of the Freedom High School Marching Band,
Concert Band, Jazz Band, and Pit Orchestra. I was also a member
of the National Honor Society.

I proudly graduated second in my class on June 8th, 2023. That night was one of reflection and gratitude for me. I sat
back and thought through what I had accomplished and who had helped me through it. How blessed I was to have had the
high school experience that I did! I am so grateful for the teachers, friends, and family who supported me along the
way.
