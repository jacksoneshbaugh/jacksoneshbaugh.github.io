Similarly to my role at Hope Alliance Church, I have created a visual system for Lafayette DiscipleMakers Christian
Fellowship that is used during our weekly gatherings. I set up the system each week, including song lyrics, message
notes, scripture references, and announcements. I also operate the system and the sound system during each gathering.
Finally, I troubleshoot any issues that may arise during a gathering. It's a simpler system than at Hope, but it has
been such a blessing to serve the fellowship in this way. I am proud of the work I have done and look forward to
continuing to improve the quality of our gatherings.
