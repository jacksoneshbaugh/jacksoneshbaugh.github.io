**This is one of the many projects you can find on my [projects page](/projects)!**

A friend reached out to me asking if I knew of any websites that present a survey in the form of a bingo board. I
didn't, but since I was on spring break, I figured I'd code it up for him real quick. The survey is displayed in the
form of a bingo board, and clicking on a tile allows you to respond to a question.

I used Python and Flask to develop the web application. I made changes based on feedback from design partners and
oversaw deployment on Google Cloud. Finally, I monitored the application for any issues that needed to be resolved.
