  As a Whitman Fellow, I aided in the creation of a database rich in detailed data about counties of the USA for use in policy studies machine learning research. Tasks consisted of finding, downloading, cleaning, and formatting datasets, then adding them to our central database. This project is dynamic and ongoing, so many different tasks may present themselves during my interim involvement with this research.
