  I had the wonderful opportunity to work as an IT Intern at WFMZ-TV in Allentown, PA. I was responsible for providing technical support to the station's employees, maintaining the station's IT infrastructure, and assisting with the station's projects. I also assisted with the station's broadcast operations, including the station's live newscasts and other live broadcasts. IT in a broadcast environment is a unique and challenging field—I did anything and everything from cleaning computers to troubleshooting broadcast equipment to building chairs (no, really). I am grateful for the opportunity to work in such a dynamic and fast-paced environment.
