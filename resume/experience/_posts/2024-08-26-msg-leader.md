I am currently an MSG leader for the "Digital Media" course at Lafayette College, an introductory computer science
course. I work closely with the professor to ensure that students are understanding the material and are able to succeed
in the course and to take valuable skills away from class. I hold two two-hour study groups each week, where students
can drop in and ask questions, work on assignments, or just chat about the material. I also help during class, answering
questions and helping students with their work.
