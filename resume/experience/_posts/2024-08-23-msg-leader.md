I am currently an MSG leader for the "Introduction to Game Programming" course at Lafayette College, an introductory
computer science
course. I work closely with professor Lauren Biernacki to ensure that students are understanding the material and are
able to succeed
in the course and to take valuable skills away from class. I hold two two-hour study groups each week, where students
can drop in and ask questions, work on assignments, or just chat about the material. I also help during class, answering
questions and helping students with their work.

In the Fall 2024 semester, I served as a leader for the "Digital Media" course under Justin Smith, and you can find the
resources I created during that semester on my [projects page](/projects).
