I created the live-streaming setup that Hope Alliance Church uses to broadcast its services and provide live video
in-house, and I maintain and operate this equipment each week. I also occasionally create graphics on an as-needed
basis (such as for a holiday). Finally, I've honed my troubleshooting skills through this role, and I'm able to quickly
identify and resolve any issues that may arise during a service.

I have learned a lot about audio and video production
through this role, and I enjoy using my skills to help the church reach a wider audience. I am proud of the work I have
done and look forward to continuing to improve the quality of our broadcasts.
