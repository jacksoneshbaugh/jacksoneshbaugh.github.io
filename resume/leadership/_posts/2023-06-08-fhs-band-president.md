I served as the President of the Freedom High School Patriot Band during the 2022–2023 school year. In this role, I
oversaw the planning of numerous events, including the annual band car wash and our hallway decoration competition. I
worked to bring the band together with a sense of pride, dignity, and spirit, and I encouraged my fellow band members
throughout the year. It was an honor to serve as the President of the Patriot Band, and I am proud of the work I did to
help make the band a welcoming and inclusive community for all of its members. I look forward to continuing to support
the band in the future.
