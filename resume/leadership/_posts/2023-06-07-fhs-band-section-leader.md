I served as the Low Brass Section Leader of the Freedom High School Patriot Band during the 2021–2023 school years. In
this role, I ensured that both the marching and music was memorized and accurate. I planned and ran sectional rehearsals
on an as-needed basis, and I served as a liaison between leadership and the section when necessary.

I really enjoyed leading my section and helping to cultivate growth both as musicians and as people.
