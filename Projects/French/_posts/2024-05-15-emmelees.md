description: >-
  This paper explores the definitions of art and science as presented in Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie (1751) and examines their relevance to contemporary life. It highlights how the Enlightenment-era work categorized a vast array of topics into art and science, noting significant differences from modern interpretations. Despite these differences, the paper argues that the Encyclopédie's definitions of art and science remain applicable today, illustrating their intertwined nature through examples like medicine and music. Ultimately, it suggests that these historical perspectives offer valuable insights into how we perceive and categorize human knowledge and creativity.
