  This paper examines two works from two authors from the Middle East: _Persepolis_ by Marjane Satrapi and _Le Jeu des Hirondelles_ by Zeina Abirached. After diving into the works themselves, exploring the power that the graphic novel carries, and considering why the authors chose this medium, I conclude by comparing the two works, finding many similarities between them.
