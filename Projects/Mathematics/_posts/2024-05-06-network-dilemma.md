description: >-
  This study surveys six different network configurations—complete, complete bipartite, hypercubes, trees, cyclic, and wheel—to evaluate their suitability for a network of 32 nodes. Through comprehensive analysis of each configuration’s cost, speed, reliabilty, and extensibility, we explore the pros and cons of each layout. Our evaluation criteria include network connectivity, vertex and edge reliability, the existence of Hamilton cycles and Euler tours, and the feasibility of network expansion. Among the configurations considered, the complete bipartite, the hypercube, and the wheel layouts emerged as the most suitable, depending on specific needs. To conclude, we provide recommendations tailored to different organizational requirements, providing a nuanced understanding of how each configuration could serve specific network infrastructure needs effectively.

This study surveys six different network configurations—complete, complete bipartite, hypercubes, trees, cyclic, and
wheel—to evaluate their suitability for a network of 32 nodes. Through comprehensive analysis of each configuration’s
cost, speed, reliabilty, and extensibility, we explore the pros and cons of each layout. Our evaluation criteria include
network connectivity, vertex and edge reliability, the existence of Hamilton cycles and Euler tours, and the feasibility
of network expansion. Among the configurations considered, the complete bipartite, the hypercube, and the wheel layouts
emerged as the most suitable, depending on specific needs. To conclude, we provide recommendations tailored to different
organizational requirements, providing a nuanced understanding of how each configuration could serve specific network
infrastructure needs effectively.
