  For my biotechnology class during my senior year of high school, I watched a TED Talk, then read the journal article that it was based on. I found a self-described computational biologist named Sara-Jane Dunn, and her work is what specifically showed me what is possible in the field of bioinformatics. This project is what first showed me the field that I have become so excited about, and I'm so glad I got to create it (and that I get to share it with you)!
