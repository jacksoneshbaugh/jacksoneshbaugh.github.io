  For my final (take-home) quiz grade in CS 202 (Analysis of Algorithms), I responded to a few open-ended questions about P vs. NP, and what the equality or inequality of these two sets of problems means for the field of computer science. I also think about the active threat quantum computers pose to some cryptography algorithms and how we may avert this threat.
