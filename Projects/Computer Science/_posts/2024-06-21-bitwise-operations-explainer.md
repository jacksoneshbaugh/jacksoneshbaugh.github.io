  I wrote this article to explain bitwise operations—and to help me understand them better. It's a deep dive into the fundamentals of bitwise operations, including AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifting, along with an introduction to how data is stored in memory. Along the way, I provide practice problems and solutions to help readers comprehend and solidify their understanding of the topic. The article ends with what I call "case studies," which are examples of how bitwise operations are used to solve real-world problems—and you get to implement solutions to these problems yourself!
