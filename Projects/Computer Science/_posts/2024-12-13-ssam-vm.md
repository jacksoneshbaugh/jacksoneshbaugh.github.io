For a lab assignment for CS 203 (Computer Organization) at Lafayette College, I was tasked with developing a virtual
machine that can run SSAM (Super Simple Assembly, developed by my professor) machine code. Tasks included developing
VRAM (`memory.c` and `memory.h`), a VCPU (`controller.c` and `controller.h`), and a UI (`sim.c` and `sim.h`).

I learned a bunch about how lower levels of computing work from this classâ€”and this lab tied plenty of concepts
together.
