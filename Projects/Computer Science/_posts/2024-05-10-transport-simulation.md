  This is a simulation of shipping trucks. The end user can configure certain settings before running the simulation, and the results are printed in a log file. I completed this as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course at Lafayette College. Notably, we weren't given any implementation details and were told to write our own planning document, which you can also find in the GitHub repository with the project.
