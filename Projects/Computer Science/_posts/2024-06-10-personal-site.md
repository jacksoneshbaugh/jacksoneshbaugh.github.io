This site is a project in and of itself! I built it using the Jekyll framework, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
original site was written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but when I needed a more efficient development workflow,
I switched to Jekyll. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, and the source is available for you to peruse!
