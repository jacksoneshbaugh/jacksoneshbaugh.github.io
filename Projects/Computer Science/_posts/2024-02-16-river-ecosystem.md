description: >-
  For this project, I was tasked with simulating a simple river ecosystem with only bears and fish. I had to consider death by both natural causes and by animals, as well as reproduction. This was the first of three projects I completed for a Data Structures and Algorithms course at Lafayette College. It was also my first project using Javadoc documentation.
