        <p>Last year, I composed a march for my high school band called “Patriot March.” Integrating the school’s alma mater (
Patriot’s Prayer from Finlandia) into the trio, I set out to compose a march that represented the four years I was on
the cusp of completing. Inspired by the work of John Philip Sousa—which is no surprise, we played “The Stars and Stripes
Forever” in each year’s pregame show and at the end of each concert—I wrote and revised the march over the course of a
few months. During our annual band banquet, I presented the march as a parting gift from the senior class to the band
program and the school. Below, I’ve included my notes from the score:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom High School has been an excellent four years of my life, and an important part of my life no less. Truly,
these years have served me well and every encounter I’ve had has been great. When we as a people find something worth
honoring, we honor it. That’s what I’m doing with Patriot March. I’m honoring everything Freedom High School is to me,
but also everything it is to everyone who has ever set foot in the school. Think about every influence this school has
in this community. From the local couple who came to one football game to the staﬀ, students, and faculty, this school
impacts practically everyone who has ever set foot in it, or who has ever experienced any of its students. If there’s
one thing I’ve definitely found through these four years, it’s that Freedom Family is a real thing. There’s a culture
here unlike anywhere else. It’s tight knit, yet everyone is welcome. It enriches our lives, fills our spirits, and
lifts
our souls.</p>

  <p>This march is loosely based on Sousa’s style of marches and follows a similar pattern of a repeated First Strain,
repeated Second Strain, Trio, Break Strain, and Grandioso. You’ll find the familiar melody of the Freedom High School
Alma Mater, “Patriot’s Prayer” from Finlandia, in both the Trio and Grandioso. Listen for the new melodies. What do
they
signify? That’s for you to decide. What does Freedom High School mean to you? That’s what this march celebrates. When
you play or listen to this march, focus on what feelings you have for your community—your Freedom Family. That’s what
drives the core of this march. Freedom High School will leave an impact on every student’s life, every teacher’s life,
and every faculty member’s life. You may not understand it now, but I know you’ll reflect in the coming years, and
you’ll be thankful for the four years you shared with your Freedom Family.</p>

<p>This year, I was invited back to conduct the band for the world premiere of “Patriot March.” I was thrilled to be able
to conduct the band for the first time and to hear the march come to life. The band played beautifully, and I was so
proud of the work they put into the piece. It was a great experience to be able to conduct the band and to hear the
march performed live.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank the band director, Mr. Mike Moran and the assistant band director, Mr. Andrew Lynn, for
extending the invitation to me. I’d also like to thank the band members for their hard work and dedication to the
music. It was an honor to conduct the band for the world premiere of “Patriot March,” and I’m grateful for the
opportunity to share my music with the community.</p>
