<h2 id="hi-im-jackson-eshbaugh-a-computer-science-and-french-student-currently-enrolled-at-lafayette-college">Hi! I’m Jackson Eshbaugh, a computer science and French student currently enrolled at Lafayette College.</h2>

<p>Since I was young, I’ve always had a knack for computers. Whether it was showing my parents how to work iPhoto on their
iMac or writing an AppleScript script, I had lots of interest in computer science from a young age. I went through my
elementary school and middle school years developing my knowledge in programming and computer science in general. I
became widely known as the “student-technician”, and teachers would ask me to troubleshoot their technology. I started
programming (not counting AppleScript—I had been using that very basically earlier) in about 5th grade, when I learned
some basic Java, so I could create Minecraft mods. In many ways, I can thank that game for giving me the tools and
impetus I needed to apply myself in the field.</p>

<p>My years at Freedom High School were some of the best years of my life. I learned and grew so much, and I made so many
great friends. Still not knowing what I wanted to do in computer science, I enrolled in A.P. Computer Science A in the
2019-2020 school year, my freshman year. I would remain interested in computer science all through high school, working
on numerous projects to fill time and for fun. However, it would take until September 2022 for me to encounter my field
of interest, one that I knew I had to look deeper into: bioinformatics. As part of a Biotechnology course that I took
during my senior year, I had to watch a TED Talk about something in biotechnology, then read the journal article that
inspired that talk. The culmination of this project was each student giving their own presentation on the subject (mine
is available on this website). I presented about the intersection between biology and computer science, something that
clicked as an immediate interest for me and I knew I had to do something with it in the future.</p>

<p>A few months later, I was in my A.P. Biology class when I was called down to the main
office. I remember being confused and a bit worried—<em>was my parking pass screwed up?</em> When I arrived, my school
counselor led me into a conference room where I was greeted by my principal, my Lafayette admissions counselor, and a
big envelope (along with a few balloons and a scarf). I was accepted into Lafayette! The next chapter of my life would
soon begin. I became a leopard.</p>

<p>And that’s where my story ends for now. I’m still young, and I’ve got so much ahead of me. But with faith in God,
perseverance, and joy, I can’t see myself stopping anytime soon. Ultimately, my goal is to become a professor of
computer science and to focus my research on bioinformatics, a field that I believe will soon explode and change the
world.</p>
